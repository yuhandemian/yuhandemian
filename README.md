<h1>Hi, I'm Yuhan Park <img  src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ABSphreak/ABSphreak/master/gifs/Hi.gif" width="30px"></h1>

I’m diving deep into **backend development**, with a strong interest in how systems scale and perform.

Recently, I’ve been exploring distributed systems and tools like **Redis, Kafka, and Elasticsearch** to better understand scalable architectures.
